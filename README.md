# Container Stowage AI

An AI-assisted container vessel stowage planning system built with FastAPI and React. The project supports cargo manifest handling, container placement, vessel layout visualization, voyage simulation, and a local AI assistant.

> **Project status:** Academic project using a synthetic vessel layout. It is not certified for real-world vessel operations.

## Features

- Cargo manifest upload and processing
- Container placement and stowage planning
- Container position validation, including 40-foot container footprints
- Synthetic vessel layout with 4,000 slots
- Multi-port voyage loading and discharge simulation
- Local AI assistant using Ollama
- Automated Python tests

## Technology Stack

**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Pandas

**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite

**AI:** Ollama with the Qwen2.5 7B model

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

- Git
- Python 3.11
- Node.js and npm
- Ollama (required for the local AI assistant)

## Installation on Windows

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd container-stowage-ai
```

Replace `<REPOSITORY_URL>` with the GitHub repository URL.

### 2. Set up the Python backend

From the project root:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the backend:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Backend API documentation:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### 3. Set up the frontend

Open a second terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite, normally:

http://localhost:5173

### 4. Set up the AI assistant

For local development, install Ollama and run:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
```

The assistant now tries providers in this order:

1. Local Qwen 2.5 7B through Ollama.
2. An optional hosted OpenAI-compatible model.
3. Built-in project knowledge for common project/stowage questions.

For a deployed frontend/backend, configure these environment variables in the hosting dashboard (do not commit API keys):

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
CLOUD_AI_BASE_URL=https://your-openai-compatible-provider.example.com/v1
CLOUD_AI_API_KEY=<set as a secret in the hosting dashboard>
CLOUD_AI_MODEL=<provider model id>
```

`CLOUD_AI_*` variables are optional locally. They are required if you want unrestricted general AI answers on a cloud deployment where Ollama is not running.

The AI endpoint also receives a bounded summary of the current uploaded manifest and latest generated plan, allowing it to answer project-context questions without inventing unavailable values.

## Running Tests

From the project root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

## Collaboration

1. Create a separate branch for each feature or fix.
2. Commit changes with descriptive messages.
3. Push the branch to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request to review changes before merging into `main`.

## Limitations

The vessel layout is synthetic. The system is intended for academic demonstration and development, not operational maritime decision-making. Real-world deployment would require additional validation for vessel stability, stack loads, structural constraints, dangerous goods segregation, and applicable maritime regulations.
